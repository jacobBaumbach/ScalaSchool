# Scala School

This is a collection of different little exercises I gave myself based on the material presented in [Scala School.](http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/) The tutorials did not come with any of their exercises, so I wrote some code to test my understanding of the material presented. I am still working through all the tutorials and will be adding more work to this repo in the near future.
